Description: Provides a bit of data and helper functions for wrapping
    around the key YAPS functions. The main function is swim_yaps, which will allow you to pass a data.table 
    that is formatted with columns ts, epo, frac, tag, serial to the function. You must have a synchronisation model
    already available that is named sync_model and a data.table object for the hydrophones and their locations named
    hydros, as per the YAPS specifications. You should be familiar with YAPS in order to use this package but it will
    hopefully help make your life easier by looping through YAPS runs N (user specified number) of times and taking the
    best fit among those runs for each fish day. You will also find some data in the package to help you try.
